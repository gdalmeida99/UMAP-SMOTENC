# UMAP-SMOTENC
Fully Synthetic Data Creation

This repository is intended to host the code from the experiments used for the developement of "UMAP-SMOTENC: A Simple, Efficient, and Consistent Alternative for Privacy-Aware Synthetic Data Generation".

It is currently still in a V0 stage, with the minimum viable code for experimentation purpose. Furthermore, as the project involves new functionalities and code optimization mechanisms may be added as well as demos and step by step explanations (currently, you will have to refer to the associated paper to get those details).

The datasets used on this experiment can be retrieved from:
